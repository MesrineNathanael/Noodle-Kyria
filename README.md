# :ramen: Noodle Kyria

This is my first custom built keyboard, it's a custom child of the [Custom Kyria](https://github.com/MoltenZaz/Handwired-Kyria) and the [Corne](https://github.com/foostan/crkbd/tree/main) keyboards.

### Build

A ready2flash firmware is available in the repository in the firmware directory.

#### Build process

1. Follow the QMK MSYS quick setup.
2. Once the full setup is done, build the firmware with this command:
`qmk compile -kb noodlekyria -km via`.
3. Then flash the built `.hex` file with QMK Toolbox.

### Parts needed for the build
